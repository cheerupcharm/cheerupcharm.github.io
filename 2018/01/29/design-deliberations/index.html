                <p><strong>From the last time</strong><br>we presented our project, we got two comments that I felt had to be addressed. The first was simply that the interface design appeared to be rather on the childish side, whether intentional or not, and the second was the question of how the app would actually help those with depression. It was already established that we hoped to help people with depression by gently encouraging them to perform even the most minute, mundane tasks and log them with our journal app, but what we had thus far failed to address was: <strong><em>how</em></strong> exactly were we going to encourage people to do things? What would our app do to make people invested in actually doing something and writing it down?</p>
<p>To respond to these two points, I decided to re-examine what the app <em>should</em> do from a design standpoint, rather than purely functionality. The app should assist someone with depression in some way, right? While the specifics of how to help any given individual is specific to their own situation, generally speaking I’d say our goal is to provide a safe space for people to just express themselves however they want.</p>
<p><strong>A “safe space”</strong><br>ended up being key to my redesign of the interface (for mobile, this time; although the desktop design still needs to be revisited). A lot of people don’t have a physical safe space, and with the rise of online/cyberbullying, trolling, and so forth, a lot of people don’t have a safe space online, either. Wikipedia even has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicides_that_have_been_attributed_to_bullying" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of suicides that have been attributed to bullying</a>, with the majority of them being in the past decade alone.</p>
<p>The idea of a safe space led me to research interior design in homes and what people consider comforting, welcoming space to be, which turned up the Danish concept of <em>hygge</em> (Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries are consistently considered the happiest countries in the world, with Denmark even having a <a href="https://www.happinessresearchinstitute.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happiness Research Institute</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Hygge</strong><br>is frequently described as the feeling of coziness and intimacy that comes from a relaxing and peaceful environment. Circumstances oft-mentioned as creating the feeling of hygge are things such as: curling up with a book in a soft, warm bed or sofa; coming inside from the winter cold and enjoying a cup of warm cocoa; eating childhood comfort foods such as your mother’s cooking.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://hyggehouse.com/hygge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HyggeHouse.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While there’s no one English word to describe hygge, several can be used interchangeably to describe the idea of hygge such as cosiness, charm, happiness, ‘contentness’, security, familiarity, comfort, reassurance, kinship, and simpleness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an effort to translate this feeling to CheerUpCharm’s design, I opted for subdued, warm colours, hand-drawn and imperfect sketches as default “furniture” to decorate the screen and create a sense of space, and fonts that emulated handwriting to create a sense of intimacy. In order to encourage users to make posts and simultaneously make the app a “safe space” that was unique to them and something they could own, I devised a point system as a way to gamify the task of making a post – users would perhaps receive some number of points for making a post, which they could use to purchase “furniture” to decorate their room.</p>

<p><strong>Mockups following the research</strong></p>
<p>The log in/sign up screens change the dog’s dialogue based on which one is focused to encourage a sense of friendliness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the main screen is designed to emulate a small room and give the user a sense of personal space. The number of “points” at the top of the screen are awarded to the user for making journal entries and can be used to “purchase” furniture for the user to decorate the room with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chat screen is for interacting with the dog as a chatbot; tapping the “Enter message…” bar at the bottom will pull up the onscreen system keyboard, while tapping the phone button will bring up a menu with options to contact either an actual suicide help hotline based on the user’s location, or a phone number which the user has registered to the menu.</p>
