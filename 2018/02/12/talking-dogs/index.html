                <p><strong>To make CheerUpCharm a little more interactive</strong><br>and a little more fun for the user, we considered adding a chat function. However, owing to the sensitivity of information that might be transmitted (since the app itself is meant to help people who may have deeply personal problems), actual chat functionality wherein the user could interact with another human user was largely unfeasible, especially if said users were anonymous. There would be too many problems that would be too difficult or time-consuming to address, particularly if harassment or abuse arose from it. If a human-to-human chat function were added, the only implementation of it that would work safely for the user would be if the user were only allowed to connect to a professional health care worker.</p>
<p>However, we did think it might be fun for the user to instead interact with a chatbot, something that would simply listen and respond in kind, perhaps offer some trivia or answer simple questions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://botui.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BotUI</a></strong><br>was what we ended up experimenting with in <a href="https://github.com/cheerupcharm/chatbot-sample" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our initial attempt at building an interactive chatbot</a>. BotUI already has a chat-like interface designed for it so that was something we needn’t concentrate on for the moment, allowing us to focus on the actual bot-building.</p>

<p><a href="https://botui.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BotUI</a> bills itself as “super easy to create conversational/bot interfaces”, and to its credit, it really is quite simple to build a chatbot using it. At its very base, it applies two concepts to its chatbot-building, “Messages” and “Actions”.</p>
<p><strong>Messages</strong> are, simply put, hardcoded text messages that the chatbot issues to the user following a predetermined flow (selected based on user responses). For example, in the small test that we created, </p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">botui.message.add(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    content: <span class="string">'How are you?'</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>simply displays the question “How are you?” to the user. </p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> are activities that are performed depending on the user response; BotUI uses <code>then()</code> to allow chaining following responses and actions to continue the conversation:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">botui.message.add(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    content: <span class="string">'How are you?'</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;).then(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> botui.action.button(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        action: [</span><br><span class="line">            &#123;</span><br><span class="line">                text: <span class="string">'I am Good!'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">                value: <span class="string">'i_am_good!'</span></span><br><span class="line">            &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">            &#123;</span><br><span class="line">                text: <span class="string">'I am tired...'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">                value: <span class="string">'I_am_tired...'</span></span><br><span class="line">            &#125;</span><br><span class="line">        ]</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The callback function defined inside <code>then()</code> is only displayed once the preceding message is displayed, and in this case that would be two buttons (using <code>action.button</code>) - one displaying the text “I am Good!” and the other “I am tired…”. Based on the button selected by the user, the chat responds with another <code>message</code> and continues chaining <code>then()</code>s.</p>

<p>Simply put, each part of the conversation using BotUI can be represented in “blocks”:</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/snowpoff/image/upload/v1518535575/chatbot-flow_zkzznl.png" alt="chatbot block"></p>
<p>BotUI offers just two types of Actions: either a text entry response from the user, or button selection. Notably, it only offers one of these two options at any given time - they cannot be used at the same time in the same single response.</p>
<p>We found BotUI extremely simple to use, but that also came with its own caveats. Because of its response chaining structure, every response the user made would have to be predetermined, which offers the user very little interaction beyond the first few times they initiate an interaction with the bot. This also means creating a complex conversation chain would be far too time-consuming and unwieldy. </p>
<p>Futhermore, because the bot itself does not recognise user inputs as anything meaningful in and of themselves, it is unable to respond in a manner that would imply intelligent interpretation, even from a grammatical standpoint - in the sample, this error can be seen quite easily.</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/snowpoff/image/upload/v1518536044/chatbot-grammar_qwmnmd.png" alt="chatbot error"></p>
<p>The user’s text input was “reading”, but the chatbot’s response was very clearly a hardcoded “You did <code>text-input</code>“. The bot would therefore be unable to remember or apply contextual information further down the conversation chain, as each part of the conversation is designed in message-action(response) blocks. </p>
<p>And – perhaps the most problematic part of creating this chatbot with BotUI – is simply that as the chat chain grows and becomes more complex, it would become entirely too difficult (or perhaps just annoying) to follow the conversation in terms of structuring the code as it would become quite lengthy, even for a short conversation.</p>
<p>However, despite BotUI being perhaps a bit on the simplistic side, it gave us an idea of how a basic chatbot functions. In order to create a more responsive/intelligent bot, we have plans to look into Google’s Cloud Machine Learning APIs (<a href="https://dialogflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dialogflow</a>). </p>
<p>Like BotUI, Dialogflow is meant to create an interactive experience for a user, but unlike BotUI, which expects hardcoded Messages and Actions, Dialogflow is far more flexible - it operates on two concepts called “<a href="https://dialogflow.com/docs/intents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intents</a>“ and “<a href="https://dialogflow.com/docs/contexts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contexts</a>“ to build responses. It is perhaps building a chatbot from the exact opposite perception of what the experience should be: rather than giving the user a preselected list of actions to use as responses, API.AI attempts to predict what or how the user will respond. </p>
<p>Of course, it still needs a list of predetermined responses, but rather than forcing the user to indicate a specific response (such as with BotUI’s buttons), Dialogflow uses machine learning to guess at and learn alternate responses from the user that carry the same meaning as what is already prerecorded, and use this information to respond appropriately.</p>
<p>“Contexts” also allow the chatbot to retain previously received information from the user and use this information later in the conversation, which preserves the integrity of the conversation - the user can continue to interact with the chatbot on a particular topic rather. In everyday human conversation, people frequently drop several words or replace them with vague terms (for example: “How was your day?” “It was good,” wherein “it” is a vague represention of the idea “your day”; it is rather unnatural for native speakers to repeat the topic as people remember it and interpret responses in that context).</p>
<p>For our project, it might be more reasonable for us to stick with a simple chatbot in order to avoid getting caught up with something rather too complex for our purposes. Either way, it’s all very exciting stuff.</p>
