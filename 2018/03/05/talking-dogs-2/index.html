                <p>Something we’re considering including in our project is the use of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s translation services</a> in order to expand our app’s accessibility, language-wise. Part of the appeal of it is just that it’s so simple to use - just put something in and it spits out the result in a very clear, easy-to-understand manner.</p>
<p>A sample POST request with curl that Google provides is as follows:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">curl -X POST \</span><br><span class="line">     -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer &quot;$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) \</span><br><span class="line">     -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8&quot; \</span><br><span class="line">     --data &quot;&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  &apos;q&apos;: &apos;Hello world&apos;,</span><br><span class="line">  &apos;q&apos;: &apos;My name is Jeff&apos;,</span><br><span class="line">  &apos;target&apos;: &apos;de&apos;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;&quot; &quot;https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>We can see that JSON data is provided in the request, containing at least one query, <code>q</code>, as well as the target language <code>target</code> (in this case, German), and sent to Google’s Translation API endpoint using a stored authentication token.</p>
<p>If everything went okay, then the returned result would be:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  &quot;data&quot;: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    &quot;translations&quot;: [</span><br><span class="line">      &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        &quot;translatedText&quot;: &quot;Hallo Welt&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">        &quot;detectedSourceLanguage&quot;: &quot;en&quot;</span><br><span class="line">      &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">      &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        &quot;translatedText&quot;: &quot;Mein Name ist Jeff&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">        &quot;detectedSourceLanguage&quot;: &quot;en&quot;</span><br><span class="line">      &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    ]</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The two queries in the POST request data are returned (in the order originally present in the request) in the <code>translations</code> array with, of course, the translation for the queried string as well as (if not initially specified in the request) the source language discovered through automatic detection.</p>
<p>Very easy. What’s important to understand about this translation and how to use it is, however, two things: firstly, that to be able to use it effectively, the user needs to know the <strong>ISO 639-1 language code</strong>, as well as the two different <strong>translation models</strong> (not specified in this particular sample code, but important) that Google’s API uses for its translations.</p>
<p>The ISO 639-1 language code is pretty self explanatory; to be able for the API to understand what langauge it should be translating to (and from, if the specificity is important), the user must provide this. Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handy list of language codes</a>.</p>
<p>The translation models are a bit more complicated and different translations will be produced depending on which one is used. There are two to know, <strong>Phrase-Based Machine Translation (PBMT)</strong> and <strong>Neural Machine Translation (NMT)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Phrase-Based-Machine-Translation"><a href="#Phrase-Based-Machine-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Phrase-Based Machine Translation"></a><strong>Phrase-Based Machine Translation</strong></h2><p>is a type of statistical machine translation where it guesses the <em>probable</em> translation for sets of phrases based on a model created from parallel, pre-translated texts; it translates based on the likelihood of a particular meaning in that context, obtained from the massive amounts of data used to build the model. This is the model traditionally used in machine translation, developed and studied over the past several decades and, perhaps to the chagrin of pretty much anyone who’s tried using a machine translator, typically results in higly literal translations that don’t often make a lot of sense. It has been suggested, however, that PBMT functions well when dealing with highly technical texts, where other aspects of language (context, tone, etc) can be safely ignored.</p>
<h2 id="Neural-Machine-Translation"><a href="#Neural-Machine-Translation" class="headerlink" title="Neural Machine Translation"></a><strong>Neural Machine Translation</strong></h2><p>is a much more recent, emerging technology that Google has started using for its translations - when the translation model is not specified, such as in the sample code above, Google will by default attempt to translate using NMT. It is modelled after neural networks in the human brain using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep learning</a> techniques in order to attempt to emulate the way humans learn, and uses algorithms to teach itself language rules. Because of this, NMT typically provides higher-quality translations at a much faster speed compared to PBMT.</p>
<p>(For more reading: <a href="https://www.matecat.com/general-pbmt-vs-nmt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matecat.com: General - PBMT vs NMT</a>, <a href="http://daily.unitedlanguagegroup.com/stories/editorials/statistical-vs-neural-machine-translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Language Group: Statistical Vs. Neural Machine Translation</a>)</p>
<p>In order to specify which model is to be used when translating, <code>model: nmt</code> or <code>model: base</code> (for PBMT) needs to be added to the request body.</p>
<p>But which one holds up better, really?</p>
<p>Here’s a piece of sample text from a Wikipedia article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ギャルは、英語において若い女性を指す girl の、アメリカ英語における俗語 gal に由来する外来語。 日本語でも英語と同様の意味を持つ場合があるが、とりわけファッションやライフスタイルが突飛と見なされながらも、それらが同世代にある程度文化として共有されている若い女性たちを指す場合にも用いる。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A natural (albeit unedited) translation made by a human translator might be, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gyaru is a loanword of the word ‘gal’ (slang used in American-English), derived from the English word ‘girl’, which is used to indicate a young woman. Although there are situations wherein the meaning of the word in both English and Japanese contexts are the same, it typically indicates a particular fashion or lifestyle, or young women who engage in this contemporary subculture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(For more reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyaru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia entry on Gyaru</a>.)</p>
<p>A translation using PBMT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gal, the girl pointing to a young woman in English, foreign language derived from the slang gal in American English. There is a case to have the same meaning as English in Japanese, but especially also with fashion and lifestyle is regarded as outlandish, also used if they refer to the young women that are shared to some extent as culture in the same generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a translation using NMT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Girl is a foreign word derived from slang gal in American English, of girl pointing to a young woman in English. Although it may have the same meaning as English in Japanese, it is used also when young women who are referring to young women who are shared to some extent as a culture to the same generation, while fashion and lifestyle are considered to be particularly funny.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we compare the PBMT and NMT translations, we can see that, while both are somewhat confusing to understand and have their own grammatical and lexical issues, PBMT is by far the more stilted of the two. PBMT selects words and phrases that are technically correct translations, but are infrequently used in regular vernacular. NMT attempts to replace these with more natural language.</p>
<p>However, in the case of CheerUpCharm, neither of these sample translations would be of much relevance - the app itself does not currently contain large amounts of text, and any text that is being used is either simple menu text, or dialogue from the dog/chatbot.</p>
<p>Another sample translation, this time with a more conversational tone (the sample text was retrieved from a <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/968375915024736256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on Twitter</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>そういえば、年明けあたりにソーシャルゲーム業界の人が「過去の統計から２月はソーシャルゲームの売上が軒並み落ちる事が判っています」って言ってて、なんか漁師みたいだなーと思った。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Natural translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah, around New Years’ someone in the social-network game industry was saying that given past stats, we know February sales in social-network games are going to drop pretty steadily and that just made me think huh, kinda sounds like a fisherman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PBMT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of which, they say per turn of the year people of the social game industry is me &quot;February from the past of Statistics has found that the sales of social games to fall across the board&quot;, I thought Na&#39;s like something fisherman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NMT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of which, people in the social gaming industry said that from the past statistics it is known that sales of social games are falling down in February and it seems that somehow seems like a fisherman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the translation issues aside, the PBMT model attempted to use quotation marks to match the original Japanese input, where the NMT model removed them entirely - which is a common translation decision to make, as quotations in Japanese aren’t necessarily as strict as verbatim quotes like in English. </p>
<p>Either way, as far as translation accuracy and fidelity goes, neither are really suitable to use for conversational dialogue, so while it’s a nice idea and could maybe be used in a pinch, machine translation probably oughtn’t be used, at least not outside of some sort of beta/demo feature. It might be acceptable for single-word translations like a menu, though.</p>
